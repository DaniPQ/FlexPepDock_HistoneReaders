# FlexPepDock_HistoneReaders
A specialized pipeline for FlexPepDock, focusing on interactions between reader domains and histone-derived peptides. The workflow includes relaxation, pinpointing pairs using an experimental native structure, and executing FlexPepDock for precise docking studies.

**Description**
This pipeline is specifically designed to study the intricate interactions between reader domains and peptides derived from histones. By utilizing the power of FlexPepDock, the workflow provides a systematic approach that includes:

Relaxation of the initial structures.
Identification of interacting pairs based on an experimental native structure.
Execution of FlexPepDock for precise peptide docking.
